# credit-risk-classification

## Introduction

This project is aimed at evaluating the Logistic Regression model's capabilities in predicting healthy and high-risk loans. The analysis is critical to assessing the model's reliability and its ability to make accurate classifications. The project employs various performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the model's performance.

## Performance Metrics

To gauge the model's effectiveness, several performance metrics have been adopted:

- **Accuracy:** This metric provides an overview of the overall correct classification rate for both healthy and high-risk loans.
- **Precision:** Precision measures the ratio of correctly predicted high-risk loans to the total predicted high-risk loans and vice versa for healthy loans.
- **Recall:** Recall assesses the proportion of actual high-risk loans correctly predicted by the model, and similarly for healthy loans.
- **F1-Score:** The F1-Score balances precision and recall into a single metric, helping to gauge the model's overall performance.
- **Balanced Accuracy:** This metric considers class imbalance and delivers a balanced assessment of the model's performance.

## Assessment

The assessment of the model's performance is based on the following criteria:

- **Accuracy Score:** The accuracy score provides a high-level view of the model's predictive power, indicating how well it predicts both healthy and high-risk loans.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** These metrics are assessed for both healthy (0) and high-risk (1) loans, allowing us to understand the model's ability to correctly classify each class.
- **Balanced Accuracy Score:** This score takes into account the imbalanced nature of the dataset, offering a balanced measure of the model's performance.
